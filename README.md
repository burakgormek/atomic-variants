## üöÄ Features

- üß© **Composable Variants** ‚Äì Define variants with base and conditional classes effortlessly.
- üì± **Responsive Variants** ‚Äì Automatically handle responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, etc.).
- üîí **Type-Safe** ‚Äì Fully typed with TypeScript for safer variant usage.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Lightweight** ‚Äì Zero dependencies, minimal runtime.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install atomic-variants
# --- or ---
yarn add atomic-variants
# --- or ---
pnpm add atomic-variants
# --- or ---
bun add atomic-variants
```

### Responsive Variants

To use responsive variants, install the **optional plugins** for your framework. These plugins ensure Tailwind includes generated responsive classes during compilation.

<details>
<summary>Next.js</summary>

Install the Next.js plugin for atomic-variants as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install @atomic-variants/next-plugin -D
# --- or ---
yarn add @atomic-variants/next-plugin -D
# --- or ---
pnpm add @atomic-variants/next-plugin -D
# --- or ---
bun add @atomic-variants/next-plugin -D
```

Wrap your Next.js config with the Atomic Variants plugin to enable responsive variant.

```js
import type { NextConfig } from "next";
import withAtomicVariants from "@atomic-variants/next-plugin";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* ... */
};

export default withAtomicVariants(nextConfig); // Wrap your config with the plugin
```

Add the generated `.atomic-variants` folder to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed.

```txt
.atomic-variants
```

Finally, make Tailwind aware of the generated classes by importing the folder in your **global.css**.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../atomic-variants";
```

This tells Tailwind to **scan** the generated variant files for class names during compilation, so those classes are recognized and compiled into your CSS.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vite</summary>

Install the Next.js plugin for atomic-variants as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install @atomic-variants/vite-plugin -D
# --- or ---
yarn add @atomic-variants/vite-plugin -D
# --- or ---
pnpm add @atomic-variants/vite-plugin -D
# --- or ---
bun add @atomic-variants/vite-plugin -D
```

Update your vite.config.ts to include the Atomic Variants plugin.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import atomicVariants from "@atomic-variants/vite-plugin";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss(), atomicVariants()],
});
```

Add the generated `.atomic-variants` folder to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed.

```txt
.atomic-variants
```

Finally, make Tailwind aware of the generated classes by importing the folder in your **global.css**.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../atomic-variants";
```

This tells Tailwind to **scan** the generated variant files for class names during compilation, so those classes are recognized and compiled into your CSS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API

### `atomic(config)`

Creates a **type-safe, composable variant function**.

| Property               | Type                                                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **base**               | `string`                                            | Base classes applied by default.                                                                                                                    |
| **override**           | `string`                                            | Classes that take precedence over **base** and **variant** classes.                                                                                 |
| **variants**           | `Record<string, Record<string \| boolean, string>>` | Defines available variants and their corresponding class names.<br><br>Supports both string and boolean variant values.                             |
| **responsiveVariants** | `boolean \| string[]`                               | Enables responsive variant support.<br><br>- `true` applies responsiveness to all variants.<br>- An array applies it only to specific variant keys. |

```ts
import { atomic } from "atomic-variants";

const variants = atomic({
  base: "text-center",
  override: "leading-none",
  variants: {
    size: {
      extraSmall: "text-xs",
      small: "text-sm",
      normal: "text-base",
      large: "text-lg",
      extraLarge: "text-xl",
    },
    padding: {
      v1: "p-1",
      v2: "p-2",
      v3: "p-3",
      v4: "p-4",
    },
  },
});

variants();
// => text-center leading-none

variants({ className: "leading-snug", size: "extraSmall" });
// => text-center text-xs leading-none leading-snug
```

> **Note:** Classes passed via **className** take priority over `override`, which takes priority over `base` and `variants`.

### Responsive Variants

You can also enable **responsive variants**, allowing you to apply different variant values at specific breakpoints. This can be done for all variants or only for specific variant keys.

```ts
import { atomic } from "atomic-variants";

const variants = atomic({
  base: "w-20 h-20",
  variants: {
    padding: {
      small: "p-1",
      large: "p-2",
    },
  },
  responsiveVariants: true, // or ["padding"]
});

variants({ padding: { xs: "small", md: "large" } });
// => w-20 h-20 p-1 md:p-2
```

> **Note:** The **xs** value is treated as default (no prefix), and other breakpoints (**sm**, **md**, **lg**, etc.) automatically get their respective prefixes.

> To use **responsive variants**, install the optional plugins for your framework. These plugins ensure Tailwind includes generated responsive classes during compilation.

## Acknowledgements

[cva](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva), [tailwind-variants](https://github.com/heroui-inc/tailwind-variants)

These projects were the main inspiration for Atomic Variants. They‚Äôre both mature, well-tested, and excellent libraries that have greatly influenced this project.

This library was created as an alternative that supports responsive variants. For **Tailwind** v4, the only way to implement responsive variants is through a custom plugin.
PR wasn‚Äôt ideal because the existing libraries are already quite complex and difficult to maintain, so it was developed as a separate experiment.
